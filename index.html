    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a multilingual venture builder based in San Diego with a background spanning tech, biotech, and international finance. I currently lead strategic partnerships at <strong>HomeLab</strong>, the largest biotech accelerator on the U.S. West Coast, where Iâ€™ve brokered major sponsorships with JP Morgan and Wilson Sonsini, and oversee cross-functional teams driving branding, events, and ecosystem growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My path includes co-founding two biotech startups focused on commercializing cutting-edge life science innovations. Iâ€™ve helped raise over $500K in funding and mentored dozens of university spinouts in pitching, fundraising, and market strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to venture building, I worked in investor relations at OurCrowd and held finance roles at Vontobel, Credit Suisse, and BlackRock across Switzerland and the U.S. Fluent in English and German, with advanced French and Spanish, I bridge global innovation ecosystems through mentorship, board service, and strategic deal-making.
